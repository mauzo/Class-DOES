=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl 5.10 introduced a new method in L<UNIVERSAL|UNIVERSAL>: C<DOES>.
This was added to support the concept of B<roles>. A role is an
interface (a set of methods, with associated semantics) that a class or
an object can implement, without necessarily inheriting from it. A class
declares that it implements a given role by overriding the C<< ->DOES >>
method to return true when passed the name of the role.

This is all well and flexible, allowing advanced object systems like
L<Moose|Moose> to implement the C<< ->DOES >> override as they see fit,
but what about ordinary classes that just want to declare they support a
known interface? That's what this module is for: you pass it a list of
roles on the C<use> line, and it gives you a C<< ->DOES >> override that
returns true for

=over 4

=item - any role in the supplied list;

=item - any class you inherit from; 

=item - any role supported by any class you inherit from.

=back

It makes the following assumptions:

=over 4

=item - All your inheritance happens through C<@ISA>.

That is, you haven't overridden C<< ->isa >>.

=item - Noone else has given you a C<< ->DOES >> method.

That is, none of your superclasses have their own C<< ->DOES >> override
(other than one provided by this module).

=back

If it detects either of these at C<use> time, it will issue a warning.

=head2 Setting C<%DOES> directly.

This module stores the roles you support in the C<%DOES> hash in your
package. If you want C<< ->DOES >> to return something other that C<1>
for a role you support, you can make an entry in your C<%DOES> hash
yourself and it will be picked up.

You should not make entries with false values, as this would be very
confusing. If you do, then when C<< ->DOES >> is called it will return
C<1> instead of the given value, and will issue a warning.

=head2 DIAGNOSTICS

All of these can be disabled with

    no warnings "Class::DOES";

=over 4

=item %s has inherited an incompatible ->DOES

You have issued C<use Class::DOES> from a class that already has a C<<
->DOES >> method. This inherited method will be completely ignored, so
any roles it claims to support will be lost.

=item %s doesn't use @ISA for inheritance

You have issued C<use Class::DOES> from a class with an overriden C<<
->isa >>. Since the exported C<< ->DOES >> method uses C<@ISA> to
determine inheritance, any extra classes C<< ->isa >> claims to inherit
from will not be checked for the requested role.

=item $%s::DOES{%s} is false, returning 1

C<< ->DOES >> has found a false entry in a C<%DOES> hash, and is
returning C<1> instead to indicate the role is supported.
